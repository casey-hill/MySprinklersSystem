Sprinklers that work with Smartthings


Step 1 - Install the Smartthings App
If you need to add more zones, just copy and paste while chaning the number.  
Step 2 - Install a new Virtual Device for new zone you created in step 1 (Name: Virtual Water Switch; Label: Water Zone3 Type: Simulated Switch; you must select location and hub too)
Step 3 - Open the Smartthings App (from step 1) and add the new virtual device from Step 2)
Step 4 - On ITPRoTechs dashboard, add the virtual switch so that you can see it.
